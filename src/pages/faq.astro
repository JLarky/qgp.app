				<p class="p-3">
					It's an extraordinarily hot and dense state of matter that existed for a brief moment
					after the Big Bang. It's also the name of this framework. Like Quark Gluon Plasma, this
					framework is designed to be extremely efficient and fast so you can build your dream
					project without worrying about performance or syncing configurations between multiple
					tools.
				</p>
				<p class="p-3">
					<strong>QGP</strong> is designed for building <strong>Multi-Page Applications</strong> (MPA's)
					with <strong>Single-Page Applications</strong> (SPA's) inside of them. It's built on top of
					<a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> and <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a>. The
					idea is to leverage Astro's island architecture to build a fast and efficient website, but
					still be able to use Vite's HMR for developing complex SPA's. In this way, both the user
					and the developer can have a great experience.

				<h4 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold text-center">The power of Astro</h4>
				<p class="p-3">
					Everything that you see right now is powered by <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a>.
					It started as a static site generator with a unique mixture of HTML and JSX templating,
					but it's become so much more! Here's a small list of it's extensive features:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside m-1">
					<li>
						Native TypeScript and Markdown support -- No need for plugins or extra configuration.
					</li>
					<li>
						Bring Your Own Framework -- <a href="https://astro.build/integrations/frameworks/"
							>Use React, Vue, Svelte, etc.</a
						> (Astro components are great too!)
					</li>
					<li>Dynamic Route Rendering -- Choose between SSG and SSR by route.</li>
					<li>
						Island Architecture -- Choose when and how to hydrate your app with JavaScript (with 0kb
						by default!)
					</li>
					<li>
						Serverless Adapters for Vercel, Netlify, and Deno Deploy -- or build the app and host it
						yourself!
					</li>
					<li>
						and more! Check out the <a href="https://astro.build"
							>website for a full list of features</a
						>.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h4 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold text-center">"Fat Islands"</h4>
				<p class="p-3">
					With Astro, you can use as little client-side javascript as you want. This counter is
					powered by a simple script tag embedded right into the <code>faq.astro</code> template.
				</p>
				<button
					class="bg-primary-DARK text-primary-LIGHT p-2 rounded-2xl m-2 hover:bg-primary-LIGHT hover:text-primary-DARK transition-all duration-300"
					id="counter">Click me (requires JS)</button
				>
				<script>
					let count = 0;
					// this is actually typescript code ðŸ¤¯
					const button = document.getElementById('counter')!;
					button.innerText = 'Click me: ' + count;
					button.addEventListener('click', () => {
						count++;
						button.innerText = 'Click me again: ' + count;
					});
				</script>
				<p class="p-3">
					But you can also use as much client-side javascript as you want. <a href="/docs"
						>Entire docs section</a
					> is implmented as SPA (with SSR/SSG) using <a
						href="https://github.com/solidjs/solid-router">solid-router</a
					>. While Astro was envisioned as a Multi-Page Application framework, QGP helps you blur
					these lines by placing one or more SPA's inside of your MPA.

				<h2 id="why-not-just-astro" class="text-2xl font-bold text-center">
					Why not just use Astro?

				<h4 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold text-center">The DX of Vite</h4>
				<p class="p-3">
					So, what's the point of QGP if Astro is already so great? Well, there's one limitation
					that we haven't explained yet. While Astro is built on top of Vite, it runs additional
					build steps that are not compatible with Vite's HMR.
				</p>
				<p class="p-3">
					This limitation is necessary for Astro to do some of its cool optimizations, but it is not
					ideal for developing complex applications. While lazy loading entire React applications
					into your site is nice, testing them can be difficult when your state is lost every time
					you save a file.
				</p>
				<h4 class="text-2xl m-2 font-bold text-center">Enter QGP</h4>
				<p class="p-3">
					QGP simply sets up an additional Vite server that runs alongside Astro. This allows you to
					use Vite's HMR to develop your React app, while still using Astro's incredibly powerful
					tools. This server is preconfigured to share environment variables and typescript
					configuration with the main Astro server, so the only thing you need to worry about is
					building your app.

					You can use the CLI to download a pre-configured template with an example app. Just follow
					these easy steps:
				</p>
				<ol class="list-decimal list-inside m-1">
					<li class="p-1">Open a terminal in your folder of choice</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Type <code>npm create qgp -t qgp-demo qgp-demo</code> to download the template. (You can
						replace the second <code>qgp-demo</code> with any folder name you want.)
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Type <code>cd qgp-demo</code> (or your project name) to enter the new folder.
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Type <code>npm i -g @antfu/ni</code> to install a helpful tool.
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Type <code>ni</code> to set up the project.
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Type <code>nr dev</code> to start the dev server.
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to see the entire site on
						the Astro dev server.
					</li>
					<li class="p-1">
						Open <a href="http://localhost:5173">http://localhost:5173</a> to see the React app on the
						Vite dev server.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					You can just enter <code>npm create qgp@latest</code> if you want to explore the other templates,
					or create your own!
