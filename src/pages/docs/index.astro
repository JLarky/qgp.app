			QGP is a small layer of glue that combines Astro and Vite. It also adds an optional layer of
			compatibility for your existing code. The idea is to leverage the power of Astro while still
			enjoying the Hot Module Reloading of Vite. Starter templates designed to be extremely similar
			to one provided by Create React App, so you can probably start with QGP instead of CRA without
			your boss realizing it.
		</p>
		<p class="">
			The best way to start is to run <code>create-qgp</code> command and to play with <a
				href="/docs/creating-a-new-site/create-qgp">the templates</a
			>. This documentation website is still a work in progress, it will soon have sections with
			instructions on how to add QGP to your existing Vite, Astro or CRA projects, but for now you
			can check out <a href="/docs/our-philosophy">Our Philosophy</a>.
