## **About the CLI**

To create a new QGP project, you can use the `create-qgp` CLI tool. We have created a few templates to help you understand QGP, get started with a new project, or migrate a project from **Create React App** (CRA) to QGP.

<br />

<Infobox hint={true}>
	We recommend you start with the *qgp-demo* template as it demonstrates some of the core features
	of QGP. Here's the <a href="#create-qgp">Installation Instructions</a>. We'll talk about the other
	templates soon.
</Infobox>

<br />

## **Installation and Usage**

If you run the CLI by itself by typing `npm create qgp@latest` in the terminal, you will be prompted to choose a template. You can also specify a template by running `npx create-qgp@latest -t <template-name> <folder-name>` with the template name and folder name of your choice although this doesn't always work right now (Alpha software is fun!).

## **The Templates**

Right now, we have three templates available:

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>qgp-demo</strong> - A simple demonstration of QGP and Astro's core features.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>qgp-cra</strong> - A template to migrate a project from CRA to QGP
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>qgp-blank</strong> - A blank template to start from scratch with Astro, Vite, and React.
	</li>
</ul>

<br />

If you have ideas for other templates, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](http://github.com/JLarky/create-qgp) or submit a pull request.

## **The qgp-demo Template**

The `qgp-demo` template is a simple demonstration of QGP and Astro's core features. It's the Astro blog template with a few modifications to demonstrate how QGP works. It is our recommended starting point for people new to QGP. You can find the source code for the template [here](https://github.com/JLarky/create-qgp/tree/master/template-qgp-demo). If you like QGP and you want to use it at work, you can show this template to your boss to demonstrate how easy it is to use.

## **The qgp-cra Template**

The `qgp-cra` template is a template to migrate a project from CRA to QGP. It's literally the entirety of Create React App's starter template held inside of a single route in Astro. You can find the source code for the template [here](https://github.com/JLarky/create-qgp/tree/master/template-astro-vite-cra-ts). After you've convinced your boss to let you use QGP, you can use this template to migrate your existing CRA project to QGP. Click [here](/docs/migrating-a-website/from-create-react-app) to learn more about migrating a project from CRA to QGP.

## **The qgp-blank Template**

The `qgp-blank` template is a blank template to start from scratch with Astro, Vite, and React. There's a few routes to remind you how things work, but it's a mostly blank canvas waiting for you to make your masterpiece. You can find the source code for the template [here](https://github.com/JLarky/create-qgp/tree/master/template-astro-vite-react-clean). If you already understand how to build single page applications inside of Astro, you can use this template to start from scratch without deleting much.
