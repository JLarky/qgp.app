	A comparison of HMR between Astro, Vite, and Create React App. Astro loses the client state with
	every file change. Vite and Create React App both maintain the client state, but Vite is
	noticeably faster.

QGP is a small layer of glue that combines Astro and Vite. It also adds an optional layer of
compatibility for your existing code. The idea is to leverage the power of Astro while still
enjoying the Hot Module Reloading of Vite. Starter templates designed to be extremely similar to
one provided by Create React App, so you can probably start with QGP instead of CRA without your
boss realizing it.

The best way to start is to run <code>create-qgp</code> command and to play with{' '}
<a href="/docs/creating-a-new-site/create-qgp">the templates</a>. This documentation website is
still a work in progress, it will soon have sections with instructions on how to add QGP to your
existing Vite, Astro or CRA projects, but for now you can check out{' '}
