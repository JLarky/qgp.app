## Introduction

We'll be transforming the standard `create-react-app` template into the `qgp-cra` template. While the app is extremely simple, the general concepts should apply to most apps that were built using CRA. The main ways that your app may differ would be if you customized your WebPack configuration or any other build factors. We'll start with the regular JavaScript version, and then we'll explain the small differences with TypeScript.
